# UI

Please help me build a feature rich markdown editor with AI functionality. You can refer to existing apps like Cursor, Notion, Obsidian, etc. The design should be minimalistic, clean and modern, focusing on the content editing and AI features.

Note: Project has already been initialized, tailwind css is integrated. It is a dioxus app, please refer dioxus.mdc rule for how to handle it.

## Features

- Rich Markdown editing with live preview, based on md-core. Please build components for each element of md-core. The whole editor should be a content editable area contains various components that holds the md-core elements.
- Manage markdown files in a folder tree
- Sidebar to view and select files

## Tech stack

- dioxus for the frontend / desktop app
- tailwind for styling
- md-core for the markdown engine
