# Core Functionality Expansion: md-core

## Document Manipulation and Navigation

The existing system focuses on document representation and serialization, but lacks comprehensive document manipulation capabilities. Adding the following core functionalities would create a more complete editing experience:

### 1. Advanced Cursor & Selection API
- Cursor movement operations (word, line, paragraph jumps)
- Multi-cursor support
- Selection expansion/contraction operations
- Selection based on document structure (select paragraph, heading, etc.)
- Text range representations and utilities

### 2. Document History & Transactions
- Transaction-based editing system
- Document history with undo/redo support
- Atomic operations for editing
- Command pattern for document operations
- Change recording and replaying

### 3. Document Structure Operations
- Moving blocks within document
- Merging and splitting nodes
- Document outline generation
- Table of contents generation
- Node insertion at specific locations

## Content Management and Analysis

The current implementation represents content well but lacks tools for analysis and manipulation:

### 1. Search and Replace
- Text search with options (case sensitive, whole word, regex)
- Structure-aware search (find in headings, code blocks, etc.)
- Advanced replacement options
- Search result navigation
- Match highlighting

### 2. Document Statistics and Analysis
- Word, character, and node counting
- Reading time estimation
- Document complexity analysis
- Heading structure validation
- Link validation

### 3. Content Validation
- Document schema validation
- Custom validation rules
- Error reporting and suggestions
- Linting for markdown best practices
- Accessibility checks

## Advanced Document Features

The library would benefit from features that enhance document capabilities:

### 1. References and Citations
- Footnote management
- Bibliography support
- Citation linking
- Cross-references between document sections
- Reference collection and formatting

### 2. Document Fragments
- Working with partial documents
- Merging document fragments
- Template support
- Document composition from fragments
- Inclusion of external content

### 3. Embedded Content
- Support for embedded media
- Interactive elements
- Custom block types
- Extension mechanism for custom content
- Rendering hints for embedded content

## Collaboration Foundations

Building blocks for collaborative editing would future-proof the library:

### 1. Operational Transformation Primitives
- Operation-based document changes
- Conflict resolution
- Document synchronization primitives
- Change tracking
- Operational transformation algorithms

### 2. Comments and Annotations
- Support for document comments
- Inline annotations
- Review/suggestion mode
- Threaded discussions
- Annotation rendering properties

## Proposed Architecture

A layered architecture with:

1. **Core Layer**
   - Document model
   - Basic operations
   - Serialization
   - Extension points

2. **Extension Modules**
   - Advanced editing
   - Navigation & selection
   - History & transactions
   - Search & analysis
   - Validation
   - References & embedded content
   - Collaboration

3. **Plugin System**
   - Custom node types
   - Custom operations
   - Custom serialization formats
   - Custom validation rules

## Implementation Strategy

- Phase 1: Define extension points in core
- Phase 2: Implement document history & transactions
- Phase 3: Implement advanced cursor & selection API
- Phase 4: Implement search & analysis
- Phase 5: Add document structure operations
- Phase 6: Create plugin system for third-party extensions

This approach allows for incremental development while maintaining backward compatibility and providing a path for users to adopt new features as needed.
