# Architecture Decision Record: Layered Architecture

## Context
After analyzing the current implementation and identifying additional core functionalities needed for a comprehensive markdown editor library, we need to define an architecture that supports these features while maintaining backward compatibility and allowing for future expansion.

## Component Analysis

### Current Components
- **Document Model** (`document.rs`, `node.rs`, `inline.rs`)
  - Represents the hierarchical document structure
  - Provides basic document manipulation operations

- **Selection Model** (`selection.rs`)
  - Basic cursor and selection representation
  - Limited cursor movement functionality

- **Serialization** (`serialization.rs`)
  - Converts between document model and various formats
  - Currently supports JSON, Markdown, and HTML

### Required New Components
- **History & Transactions**
  - Transaction-based editing system
  - Undo/redo functionality

- **Advanced Selection & Navigation**
  - Enhanced cursor movement
  - Structure-aware selection operations

- **Search & Analysis**
  - Document searching capabilities
  - Content analysis tools

- **Validation**
  - Schema-based validation
  - Content linting and suggestions

- **Extension System**
  - Plugin architecture
  - Custom node types and operations

## Architecture Options

### Option 1: Modular Extension of Current Architecture
Extending the current architecture with optional modules for each feature group.

**Pros:**
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Users can opt-in to specific functionality
- Controlled growth of core library size

**Cons:**
- Potential integration challenges between modules
- Could lead to inconsistent API design
- Overhead in managing dependencies between modules

### Option 2: Integrated Comprehensive API
Building all functionality into an integrated API with a cohesive design.

**Pros:**
- Consistent API experience
- Better integration between features
- Simpler mental model for users

**Cons:**
- Larger core library size
- All users get all features whether needed or not
- Potentially higher complexity for simple use cases

### Option 3: Layered Architecture with Core/Extensions
A minimal core with well-defined extension points and official extension packages.

**Pros:**
- Clean separation of concerns
- Users can include only what they need
- Easier to maintain and evolve
- Better testability

**Cons:**
- Requires careful API design for extension points
- Potential version compatibility issues between extensions
- Initial design more complex

## Decision
**Chosen Option:** Option 3 - Layered Architecture with Core/Extensions

This architecture provides the best balance between flexibility and cohesion, allowing for controlled growth without bloating the core library. It aligns with Rust ecosystem practices and enables specialized extensions for different use cases.
