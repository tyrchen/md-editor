# Feature Planning: Enhanced Markdown Support

## Requirements Analysis
- Core Requirements:
  - [x] Assess current Markdown feature support
  - [ ] Implement GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) extension support
  - [ ] Enhance table implementation beyond basic structure
  - [ ] Support additional Markdown features commonly found in modern implementations

- Technical Constraints:
  - [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with existing document model
  - [ ] Ensure serialization to all formats (JSON, HTML, Markdown) works with new features
  - [ ] Keep performance efficient with more complex structures

## Component Analysis
- Affected Components:
  - **Node structure** (`node.rs`)
    - Changes needed: Extend Node enum with new GFM node types
    - Dependencies: May affect document.rs and serialization.rs

  - **Table implementation** (`node.rs`)
    - Changes needed: Enhanced table model with alignment, spanning, and formatting
    - Dependencies: Affects serialization to all formats

  - **Serialization** (`serialization.rs`)
    - Changes needed: Add support for new GFM features in conversion functions
    - Dependencies: Will need markdown and HTML parser implementations

  - **Parsing** (new modules needed)
    - Changes needed: Implement proper Markdown and HTML parsing
    - Dependencies: Integration with external libraries (pulldown-cmark, html5ever)

## GFM Feature Analysis

### Standard GFM Features to Implement:
1. **Tables with Enhanced Support**
   - Column alignment (left, center, right)
   - Header formatting
   - Cell formatting
   - Row spanning (advanced)
   - Column spanning (advanced)

2. **Task Lists with Interactive Support**
   - Current: Basic task lists
   - Enhancement: Interactive toggling
   - Track completion state

3. **Strikethrough**
   - Current: Basic support exists
   - Enhancement: Proper semantic handling

4. **Autolinks**
   - Convert bare URLs to clickable links
   - Support for email autolinks

5. **Fenced Code Blocks with Language-specific Highlighting**
   - Current: Basic code blocks
   - Enhancement: Better language support
   - Syntax highlighting hints

### Extended Markdown Features:
1. **Footnotes**
   - Reference-style footnotes
   - Automatic numbering
   - Back-references

2. **Definition Lists**
   - Term and definition structure
   - Multiple definitions per term

3. **Emojis**
   - GitHub-style emoji shortcuts
   - Unicode emoji support

4. **Mentions and References**
   - @username mentions
   - #issue references
   - Repository references

5. **Mathematical Notation**
   - LaTeX-style math
   - Inline and block formats

## Implementation Strategy
1. Phase 1: Core GFM Features
   - [ ] Extend document model for GFM features
   - [ ] Enhance table implementation
   - [ ] Add strikethrough and autolink support
   - [ ] Update serialization for new features

2. Phase 2: Table Enhancement
   - [ ] Implement column alignment
   - [ ] Add support for row/column spanning
   - [ ] Create table manipulation functions
   - [ ] Add table-specific formatting

3. Phase 3: Footnotes and Extended Features
   - [ ] Add footnote support
   - [ ] Implement definition lists
   - [ ] Add emoji support
   - [ ] Design mention/reference system

4. Phase 4: External Parser Integration
   - [ ] Integrate pulldown-cmark for Markdown parsing
   - [ ] Integrate html5ever for HTML parsing
   - [ ] Create adapters for model conversion

## Library Evaluation for Integration
| Library        | Purpose          | Pros                         | Cons                   | Status      |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------- |
| pulldown-cmark | Markdown parsing | Fast, compliant, GFM support | May need customization | Recommended |
| markdown-rs    | Markdown parsing | Pure Rust, modern            | Less mature            | Alternative |
| html5ever      | HTML parsing     | HTML5 compliant, well-tested | Complex API            | Recommended |
| comrak         | Markdown parsing | CommonMark + GFM             | May be overkill        | Alternative |

## Testing Strategy
- Unit Tests:
  - [ ] Tests for each new GFM feature
  - [ ] Table-specific tests for alignment and spanning
  - [ ] Serialization tests for new features
  - [ ] Edge case handling for complex cases

- Integration Tests:
  - [ ] Markdown roundtrip tests (md -> model -> md)
  - [ ] HTML roundtrip tests (html -> model -> html)
  - [ ] Complex document tests with multiple features
  - [ ] Benchmark tests for performance evaluation

## Documentation Plan
- [ ] Update API documentation for new types and functions
- [ ] Create examples showcasing GFM features
- [ ] Add specific documentation for table API
- [ ] Create a feature compatibility matrix
- [ ] Document differences between Markdown flavors supported

## Implementation Timeline Estimation
1. Phase 1: Core GFM Features - 2 weeks
2. Phase 2: Table Enhancement - 2 weeks
3. Phase 3: Footnotes and Extended Features - 2 weeks
4. Phase 4: External Parser Integration - 2 weeks

Total estimated time: 8 weeks for full implementation
