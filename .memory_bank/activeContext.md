## Current Focus
Currently working on planning enhanced Markdown support, with a specific focus on GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) and improved table functionality.

### Planning for Enhanced Markdown Support
A comprehensive plan has been developed for implementing:
1. **GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) Features**:
   - Enhanced tables with alignment, spanning, and formatting
   - Interactive task lists
   - Improved strikethrough support
   - Autolinks
   - Enhanced code blocks

2. **Extended Markdown Features**:
   - Footnotes
   - Definition lists
   - Emoji support
   - Mentions and references
   - Mathematical notation

3. **Implementation Strategy**:
   - Four-phase approach over an estimated 8 weeks
   - Integration with external libraries (pulldown-cmark, html5ever)
   - Comprehensive testing strategy for new features

### Previous Work
Work on error handling in the codebase has been completed:

1. **Basic Error Handling** (`examples/error_handling.rs`):
   - Shows direct use of ParseError
   - Demonstrates error matching, propagation with `?`, and custom error creation
   - Focus on simple, straightforward error handling

2. **Advanced Error Handling** (`examples/advanced_error_handling.rs`):
   - Shows integration with thiserror for application-level error types
   - Demonstrates error conversion, context, and structured error handling
   - Implements a small DocumentManager to show real-world usage patterns

Clippy lint warnings throughout the codebase have been fixed:
- Added `#[allow(dead_code)]` for potentially useful functions
- Fixed unused imports and variables
- Improved code by removing unused enumerate() calls
- Fixed documentation tests to remove unnecessary main() function
- Leveraged #[derive(Default)] instead of manual implementation

## Immediate Next Steps
- Begin implementation of core GFM features according to the plan
- Research integration with pulldown-cmark for Markdown parsing
- Develop enhanced table model with alignment and spanning support
- Create tests for new GFM functionality
