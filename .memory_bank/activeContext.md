# Active Context: md-core

## Current Focus
Implementing GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) features, with a focus now shifting to autolinks and task list interactivity after successfully completing enhanced table functionality.

### Recently Completed: Enhanced Table Support
Enhanced table functionality has been successfully implemented with the following features:
- Cell spanning (rowspan/colspan)
- Row & column alignment with extended options
- Advanced table styling properties (borders, striped rows, etc.)
- Cell styling (background colors, custom styles)
- Header vs. data cell distinction
- Table caption support
- CSS class integration
- Enhanced HTML serialization

### Ongoing Implementation for GFM Support
Further implementation of GitHub Flavored Markdown features is continuing with:
1. **Next Features to Implement**:
   - Autolinks
   - Interactive task lists
   - Enhanced code blocks with language-specific features

2. **Implementation Strategy**:
   - Integration with external libraries (pulldown-cmark, html5ever)
   - Comprehensive testing strategy for new features

### Implementation Progress
Core features have been successfully implemented:

1. **Document Structure**:
   - Basic document structure (Document, Node, InlineNode)
   - Rich text formatting (bold, italic, code, strikethrough)
   - Lists (ordered, unordered, tasks)
   - Enhanced table support with styling and formatting
   - Code blocks with language support

2. **Commands**:
   - Content insertion commands
   - Selection-based operations
   - Advanced document structure operations (tables, grouping, TOC)
   - Enhanced table operations with styling capabilities

3. **Serialization**:
   - JSON serialization/deserialization
   - Markdown output serialization
   - HTML output serialization with enhanced table support

### Previous Work
Work on error handling in the codebase has been completed:
- Basic error types for parsing
- JSON error conversion
- Error handling examples

Clippy lint warnings throughout the codebase have been fixed:
- Added `#[allow(dead_code)]` for potentially useful functions
- Fixed unused imports and variables
- Improved code by removing unused enumerate() calls
- Fixed documentation tests to remove unnecessary main() function
- Leveraged #[derive(Default)] instead of manual implementation

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Implement autolinks support following GFM specification
2. Improve task list interactivity
3. Enhance code blocks with language-specific features
4. Research and prepare for integration with pulldown-cmark for Markdown parsing
5. Create unit tests for new GFM functionality
