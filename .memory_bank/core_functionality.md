## Options Analysis

### Option 1: Modular Extension of Current Architecture
Extending the current architecture with optional modules for each feature group.

**Pros:**
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Users can opt-in to specific functionality
- Controlled growth of core library size
- Faster initial implementation

**Cons:**
- Potential integration challenges between modules
- Could lead to inconsistent API design
- Overhead in managing dependencies between modules
- May result in duplication across modules

### Option 2: Integrated Comprehensive API
Building all functionality into an integrated API with a cohesive design.

**Pros:**
- Consistent API experience
- Better integration between features
- Simpler mental model for users
- Potentially more optimized implementations

**Cons:**
- Larger core library size
- All users get all features whether needed or not
- Potentially higher complexity for simple use cases
- Less flexibility for specialized use cases

### Option 3: Layered Architecture with Core/Extensions
A minimal core with well-defined extension points and official extension packages.

**Pros:**
- Clean separation of concerns
- Users can include only what they need
- Easier to maintain and evolve
- Better testability
- More flexible for specialized extensions

**Cons:**
- Requires careful API design for extension points
- Potential version compatibility issues between extensions
- Initial design more complex
- May introduce some overhead at extension boundaries

## Recommended Approach
**Option 3: Layered Architecture with Core/Extensions** is recommended for implementing the additional core functionalities.

**Justification:**
1. Provides the most flexibility while maintaining a cohesive API
2. Allows users to opt-in to only the functionality they need
3. Enables specialized extensions without bloating the core
4. Better supports long-term maintainability and evolution
5. Aligns well with Rust ecosystem practices (feature flags, optional dependencies)

The layered approach divides functionality into:
- **Core Layer**: Essential document model, basic operations, serialization
- **Extension Modules**: Optional features like history, advanced selection, search
- **Plugin System**: Framework for custom extensions

**Technical Feasibility:** High
- Rust's trait system and feature flags provide good support
- Clear implementation path with proven patterns
- Builds on existing architecture strengths

**Risk Assessment:** Medium
- Careful API design required for extension points
- Initial refactoring complexity
- Potential for version compatibility challenges between extensions

## Implementation Guidelines

### API Design Principles
1. **Extension Traits**: Define extension traits for core types to add functionality
2. **Stable Interfaces**: Create stable trait interfaces for extension points
3. **Feature Flags**: Use Rust's feature flags for optional functionality
4. **Event System**: Implement an event system for document changes
5. **Plugin Registration**: Create a mechanism for registering extensions

### Core Layer Refactoring
1. Identify and extract essential interfaces for core components
2. Define extension points with trait bounds
3. Implement event propagation for document changes
4. Create minimal versions of current functionality

### Extension Module Development
1. Group related functionality into cohesive extension modules
2. Define clear dependencies between extensions
3. Implement feature-specific traits and types
4. Create comprehensive tests for each extension

### Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Core layer redesign (3-4 weeks)
2. **Phase 2**: Essential extensions (4-6 weeks)
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced extensions (6-8 weeks)
4. **Phase 4**: Collaboration foundations (4-6 weeks)
5. **Phase 5**: Plugin system (4-5 weeks)

## Verification
The recommended layered architecture satisfies the requirements:
- âœ“ Maintains backward compatibility through carefully designed core
- âœ“ Supports all identified functionality through extensions
- âœ“ Clearly defines boundaries between core and extensions
- âœ“ Prioritizes performance by keeping core lightweight
- âœ“ Provides extensibility through trait-based extension points
- âœ“ Aligns with Rust idioms using traits and feature flags

The approach balances immediate needs with long-term flexibility, enabling the library to grow in a controlled and cohesive manner while maintaining its focus on core document editing capabilities.
