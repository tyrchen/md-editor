## UI Implementation Plan

### Prerequisite Tasks
- [ ] Verify md-core has all required functionalities for rich text editing
- [ ] Ensure proper serialization/deserialization between Document and Markdown/HTML

  - [ ] CodeBlockRenderer
  - [ ] ListRenderer (ordered, unordered, tasks)
  - [ ] TableRenderer
  - [ ] BlockquoteRenderer
  - [ ] HorizontalRuleRenderer
- [ ] Implement inline format renderers for text styling:
  - [ ] BoldRenderer
  - [ ] ItalicRenderer
  - [ ] CodeRenderer
  - [ ] StrikethroughRenderer
  - [ ] LinkRenderer
- [ ] Create EditorState to manage document state and cursor position

### Phase 2: Interactive Editing
- [ ] Create EditorController to handle keyboard events
- [ ] Implement input handling for content editing:
  - [ ] Text insertion
  - [ ] Text deletion
  - [ ] Node splitting/merging
  - [ ] Formatting shortcuts
- [ ] Create selection handling:
  - [ ] Text selection within nodes
  - [ ] Multi-node selection
  - [ ] Selection-based formatting
- [ ] Implement clipboard operations:
  - [ ] Copy
  - [ ] Cut
  - [ ] Paste

### Phase 3: File System Integration
- [ ] Design file explorer sidebar
- [ ] Implement file system operations:
  - [ ] List files in directory
  - [ ] Open file
  - [ ] Save file
  - [ ] Create new file
  - [ ] Delete file
- [ ] Implement file tree visualization
- [ ] Add drag and drop functionality

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- [ ] Create live preview panel
- [ ] Implement split-view editing
- [ ] Add search and replace functionality
- [ ] Create toolbar for common formatting operations
- [ ] Implement status bar with document statistics

### Phase 5: AI Features
- [ ] Define AI integration points
- [ ] Implement AI-assisted editing features:
  - [ ] Text completion
  - [ ] Content suggestions
  - [ ] Formatting assistance
  - [ ] Grammar/spelling checking
- [ ] Create UI for AI interaction

### Phase 6: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement virtualization for large documents
- [ ] Optimize rendering for complex documents
- [ ] Implement incremental updates
- [ ] Add caching for parsed documents

## Notes
- All commands should follow the Command pattern
- All commands should be properly tested for both execute and undo operations
- Document all commands in the memory bank
- Use existing Rust libraries where appropriate (pulldown-cmark, html5ever)
